## Random-Hub
A random hub plugin for Bungeecord Servers.

The functionality is quite simple, just load the plugin into your plugins file in Bungeecord, and modify the configuration file to how you want it, including all your lobby servers, as well as the messages that you would like to be displayed.

```json
servers:
  - hub-1
  - hub-2

messages:
  connected: "&5&l<!> &dYou were connected to &f{server}&d."
  already-connected: "&5&l<!> &dYou seem to already be connected to this lobby."
```

If you have any problems with this plugin, contact me on Discord @ marcuz#9158.
